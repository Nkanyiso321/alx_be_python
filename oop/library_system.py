Perfect! Here's the complete implementation of library_system.py that fulfills all the requirements for mastering inheritance and composition in Python:

📂 Directory: alx_be_python/oop
✅ File: library_system.py
# library_system.py

class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author

    def get_details(self):
        return f"Book: {self.title} by {self.author}"


class EBook(Book):
    def __init__(self, title, author, file_size):
        super().__init__(title, author)
        self.file_size = file_size

    def get_details(self):
        return f"EBook: {self.title} by {self.author}, File Size: {self.file_size}KB"


class PrintBook(Book):
    def __init__(self, title, author, page_count):
        super().__init__(title, author)
        self.page_count = page_count

    def get_details(self):
        return f"PrintBook: {self.title} by {self.author}, Page Count: {self.page_count}"


class Library:
    def __init__(self):
        self.books = []

    def add_book(self, book):
        self.books.append(book)

    def list_books(self):
        for book in self.books:
            print(book.get_details())

🧪 Testing with main.py
Your provided main.py script will work seamlessly with this setup. When executed, it will produce:
Book: Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen
EBook: Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson, File Size: 500KB
PrintBook: The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, Page Count: 234


Let me know if you’d like help adding unit tests, documentation, or pushing this to GitHub with a proper README and structure!
